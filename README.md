# User Styles for Edux Lectures @ [PJATK](http://www.pja.edu.pl) [![Gitmoji](https://img.shields.io/badge/gitmoji-%20ðŸ“–%20ðŸ› -FFDD67.svg?style=flat-square)](https://gitmoji.carloscuesta.me) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/lukaszklis/pjatk-edux-lectures-user-styles.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/lukaszklis/pjatk-edux-lectures-user-styles)

After becoming a student at PJATK, I was extremely disappointed with the readability of the lectures provided online.
Based on Mediumâ€™s typography settings I decided to improve Eduxâ€™s typography just a bit, so it would be possible to
read the materials at all.

1. Install dependencies via: `yarn` (or `npm i`).
