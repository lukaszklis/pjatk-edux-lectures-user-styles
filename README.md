# Users Styles for Edux Lectures @ [PJATK](http://www.pja.edu.pl) [![Gitmoji](https://img.shields.io/badge/gitmoji-%20ðŸ“–%20ðŸ› -FFDD67.svg?style=flat-square)](https://gitmoji.carloscuesta.me)

After becoming a student at PJATK, I was extremely disappointed with the readability of the lectures provided online.
Based on Mediumâ€™s typography settings I decided to improve Eduxâ€™s typography just a bit, so it would be possible to
read the materials at all.
